shortref
--------

This is an extension to the 'hyperref' LaTeX package. It adds the command
\sautoref that functions similarly to the traditional \autoref. Whereas
\autoref will print "Lemma 5.4", \sautoref is intended to print something like
"L5.4". Similarly, \autoref might yield "section 1.1", whereas \sautoref could
be made to give "\S 1.1".

I originally made this so that I could put compact references on mathmode/TikZ
arrows. The hook functionality is the same as with autoref, but everything is
prefixed with an 's'. For example:

\providecommand*\figureautorefname{Figure} % hyperref default for \autoref
\providecommand*\figuresautorefname{F} % shortref example for \sautoref

The former will give "Figure 1.2" (for example), while the latter would then
give "F1.2".
